            <h1>Security measures and vaccines</h1>
            <p>Pandemics don’t go unchecked, however. Sooner or later, the government will step in. What are the measures that can be taken? And how effective are they?
 
                <br>One of the most common security measures is social distancing. By reducing the number of interactions a susceptible person 
                has with an infected one, the number of new cases goes down.
                
                It is important to note however that even if a very small fraction of the population doesn't respect the security measures,
                 it could significantly prolong the epidemic.
                
                Lockdowns can be seen as an extreme form of social distancing.<br/>
                
                It is certainly effective if respected, however one must also consider the collateral effects social distancing measures,
                 both ones as extreme as lockdown and even milder ones have on society.<br/>
                Prolonged isolation can lead to worsening mental health conditions, an increase in stress, anxiety and loneliness.
                A balance must be found between security measures and the restrictions that can be imposed to people.<br/>
                Social distancing is effective if a disease spreads through physical contact, but is less useful when the disease spreads by
                other means like contaminated food or mosquitoes and other insects.

            </div>
            <p>Another method of social distancing consists in imposing quarantine to all the infected people. In our simulation, this consists in moving infected people out of the main area into a second isolated container.

            <p>The term “social distancing” wasn’t introduced till the XXI century, however, it has been present as a security measure since the fifth century B.C. It is even mentioned in the Bible.<br/>
                “As long as they have the disease, they remain unclean. They must live alone; they must live outside the camp.” (Lev. 13: 45–46)

                <p>All the strategies we have described have one thing in common: they don’t stop an epidemic, but simply slow it down.
                    However, slowing down the infection rate is still important, as it allows time for the development of a cure.
                    <br/>
                    The development of vaccines requires extensive researches that can take years of time, despite the collaboration of various
                     states and their experts.<br/>
                    An example of this effort is the effort that numerous states are making against Covid-19. Given the limited number of doses,
                     the vaccination campaign gives priority to the working class and to the most vulnerable age ranges.<br/>
                    There are several strategies that can be used to distribute vaccines.<br/>
                    In 1966, the WHO launched a global program to eliminate smallpox. By 1966, smallpox had been eradicated.<br/>
                    Initially, the WHO had tried to vaccinate the majority of the population in all countries where smallpox was present. Despite the high vaccination rates, it wasn’t very successful. In Nigeria, faced with an explosion of smallpox cases with a limited supply of vaccines, Dr. William Foege proposed a strategy called “ring vaccination”.<br/>
                    Instead of vaccinating everyone, they focused on identifying cases and vaccinating all the people who the infected people
                     had come into contact with, creating a "ring" of immune people around the infected.<br/>
                        This strategy was extremely effective, and was used around the world to combat smallpox and other epidemics.<br/>
                        Smallpox however has a short incubation period and very clear symptoms. It is therefore not possible to use the same vaccination strategy
                         for all epidemics, but it is necessary to evaluate and adapt the strategy based on the characteristics of the current pathogen.<br/>
                        The "pulse" vaccination strategy is a method that consists in repeatedly vaccinating an at risk group until the disease is defeated.<br/>
                        It was used in India to eliminate polio by vaccinating all children under the age of five. Vellore was the first Indian state to become
                         completely polio-free using this strategy, followed by the rest of the country.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    In these few pages we’ve done our best to explain the spread of diseases, with the help of simulations and historical references. <br/>
                    We hope we have succeeded in conveying a greater awareness of epidemics and the factors they are influenced by. If you enjoyed the simulations, you are welcome to interact with each of them again in the next section.

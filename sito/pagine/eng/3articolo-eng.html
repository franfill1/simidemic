        <p>One of the biggest questions, raised from the very beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, was  considering how the healthcare system 
            would have tolerated the unusually high number of patients. <br/>
            Everyone was caught unprepared and soon, hospitals were overwhelmed by Covid-19 cases. With a limited number of healthcare workers
             and hospital beds, it was inevitable that this would have an effect on the mortality rate of the pandemic.<br/>
            Analyzing data relative to Covid-19 patients hospitalized in Israel between mid July 2020 and mid January 2021, one can observe how a 
            moderately high number of patients (500-800, relative to the country’s maximum capacity of 800 patients) led to a higher mortality 
            rate compared to periods with less patients.<br/>
            When confronting the number of deaths in different countries during a pandemic, one mustn't consider the total number of deceased,
             but rather the excess mortality: the number of deaths in a given period that exceeds the expected amount of deaths for the given 
             area.<br/>
            Even this method isn’t perfect. It doesn’t take into account the fact that a disease is never uniformly present, but tends to be
             concentrated in localized outbreaks, however, it still gives a relatively more accurate measure to compare different countries.<br/>
             <br/>
            While there seem to be connections between hospital capacity and mortality rate, it is also possible that this is due to countries with
             more equipped healthcare’s tendency to lockdown faster, reducing the overall number of cases. An overwhelmed healthcare system will however
              certainly have an effect on the care available to its patients, therefore increasing mortality.<br/>
              <br/>
            There are other ways in which overburdened hospitals could have an impact, for example, diverting funds from other sectors, or overlooking
             people with health conditions by cancelling or rescheduling vital visits.<br/>
            In the simulation, the mortality rate will increase in relation to the number of current cases, so that at the peak of the epidemic,
             one can observe the effect of overwhelmed hospitals.<br/>

            <p>The simulation so far has remained static, with all our little people standing neatly in a grid. This model does not represent a realistic situation. People are constantly on the move, going from place to place, meeting people in the course of their day. We will introduce the pseudo causal movement of the people.
            </p>
            <img class="simulpic" src="../../immagini/ezgif.com-gif-maker (1).gif" width="50%" height="auto"/>
            <p>The constant movement of the people varies the number of encounters each individual will have, increasing the randomness of the
                 results. Running a simulation multiple times with the same initial values could lead to drastically different results.<br/>
                It is this randomness, whose secondary effects ripple out more and more, that make studying epidemics so hard. An example 
                of this can be seen with super-spreaders.<br/>
                In January 2020, a korean woman infected at least 37 people she went to church with, sending a previously tame situation 
                spiraling out of control.<br/>
                <br/>
                Even a single person, coming into contact with an unusually high number of people, can drastically worsen an epidemic.<br/>
                Some cases of super spreading conform to the Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule), that claims that around 20% of infected people are responsible for 80% of the new cases.

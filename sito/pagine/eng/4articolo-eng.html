        <h1>Central locations and communities</h1>
        <p>In 1854, there was an outbreak of cholera in Soho, a district in London. Cholera is an intestinal disease that, if gone untreated, 
            has a mortality rate of 25-50%. When there was an explosion of cases around Broad Street, killing more than 500 people in two weeks,
             Doctor John Snow set out to prove his theory: that the epidemic was caused by a contamination of the water supply.<br/>
            In the mid nineteenth century, most people collected water from communal pumps or wells.
            John Snow studied and mapped out the cholera outbreak, individuating the cause of the epidemic as the local water pump. <br/>
            To confirm his theory, Snow also collected information on people who hadn’t gotten ill, and concluded that many of such people had 
            taken water from other sources.<br/>
            It wasn’t easy for John Snow to convince the authorities that the water pump -which had been contaminated by dirty sewer water- was 
            the cause of the epidemic: at the time most people believed the cause of the epidemic to be a “miasma” an oppressive cloud that caused
             people to fall it. Nonetheless, John Snow’s studies were extremely important, and he is known today as one of the founders of 
             epidemiology. <br/>
            This historical anecdote serves to showcase the importance of central locations. In John Snow’s case, it was a water pump, 
            in our day and age, central locations take the form of offices, schools, supermarkets, etcetera. It is impossible to completely 
            avoid these places, and while one won’t get sick simply by visiting said location like in John Snow’s case, they still have an 
            immense effect in the spread of a disease.<br/>

            <p>A good way to analyze the expansion of an epidemic is to understand how the disease spreads in the various communities that make up a country. It is evident that considering the population as uniformly distributed is far from correct. <br/>
                The factors are many: differences in density, hospital and bureaucratic resources (even tracking cases isn’t always possible), 
                and general social differences.<br/>
                <br/>
                When there is an outbreak in a community, it is often possible to consider the community as a whole as if it were a single 
                individual. It is possible, for example, for a state to decide to act differently towards different areas to best slow down the
                 spread.<br/>
                This relationship between people and communities is one of the many examples of fractal recursion, often present in nature.
